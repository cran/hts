v4.0 (10 Feb 2014)
* Speeded up all existing functions.
* Restructured hts function. Argument g is replaced with nodes. Added bnames and 
	characters to allow custom names.
* Added argument gnames to gts function.
* Argument groups in gts function allows the gmatrix with characters.
* Replaced allts function with aggts in which users can specify whatever levels 
	they like.
* Renamed Smatrix to smatrix.
* Added summary.gts function.
* Added more arguments to forecast.gts such as keep.fitted, keep.resid, lambda, 
	weights.
* When setting method = "mo" in forecasts.gts, argument level started with 0 
	rather than 1.
* Import parallel package in order to support for parallel processing.
* Added more criterions to accuracy.gts function. When keep.fitted = TRUE in 
	forecast.gts function, accuracy.gts can also return in-sample error measures 
	at the bottom level.
* Dropped argument criterions in accuracy.gts function.
* Added argument weights to combinef function. When it's a hts object, argument 
	nodes is used instead of the summing matrix.
* combinef function only return time series at the bottom level. Dropped
	arguments return and hierarchical.
* Argument levels in plot.gts function allows more flexibilities.

v3.01 (7 May 2013)
* Added the infantgts data
* Added the vignette

v3.00 (7 March 2013)
* Restructured gts objects and dropped hts objects. A flag indicates if gts is 
	hierarchical.
* gts objects can now contain forecasts as well as historical data.
* Updated plot.gts function with an option to show historical data as well as 
	forecasts
* Added the window.gts function
* Moved SparseM from Depends to Imports

v2.02 (3 November 2011)
* Bug fixes to cope with much bigger hierarchies

v2.01 (3 November 2011)
* Changed hierarchical naming convention to allow much bigger hierarchies.

v2.0 (2 September 2011)

* Added grouped time series (gts) objects, and re-wrote many functions in order 
	to handle them.
* hts objects are now a subset of gts objects.
* Some old hts methods have been replaced by gts methods.
* Rob J Hyndman took over maintenance of the package from Han Lin Shang
